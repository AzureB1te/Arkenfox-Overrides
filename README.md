# Arkenfox-Overrides
This is my current list of all the overrides I use with [Arkenfox](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js)
Keep in mind that these tweaks are somewhat specific to my usecase, but should still be usefull as a starting-point for some overrides. 
Here's what you need to know:
- I use Firefox as my daily driver
- I never do video-conferencing
- I never use heavier web-applications (like. Photopea or such)
- I use Bitwarden as my one and only password manager
- I don't have any other extensions than uBlock Origin and Bitwarden
- I use Windows 11, x86-64
- I never sync my browsing data
- I self host my [Instance of Whoogle](https://github.com/benbusby/whoogle-search)

Now, my list:
The actual list with explanations for every file can be found [here](https://github.com/AzureB1te/Arkenfox-Overrides/blob/main/user-overrides.js)


This list will change over time, I'll do my best to keep it updated, if I find out more stuff, that's worth changeing. 

##Additional Notes

1. Contributions are accepted, both in tweaks to the flags themselves and the explanations I provided, as my research was rather limited. 
2. Feel free to fork this, it's MIT Licenesed
3. Don't open issues about philosopy related problems such as enableing sync
